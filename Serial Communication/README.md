The Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter `(USART)` module is one of the two serial I/O modules. (USART is also known as a Serial Communications Interface or `SCI`.) The USART can be configured as a full-duplex asynchronous system that can communicate with peripheral devices, such as CRT terminals and personal computers, or it can be configured as a half-duplex synchronous system that can communicate with peripheral devices, such as A/D or D/A integrated circuits, serial EEPROMs, etc.

The USART can be configured in the following modes:
- Asynchronous (full-duplex)
- Synchronous – Master (half-duplex)
- Synchronous – Slave (half-duplex)
